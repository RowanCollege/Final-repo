## About me 
Here is the final game I have made for the class. The game is inspired by bop it and will use the buttons switches lights microphone and accerometer found in the cpx board. the game will call an action and after a period of time if th input is not given then it will end the game. the actions called are randomly selected. the game start with button presses that put it into either endless or fixed level mode. the outpts will come from the speaker and the ligths.
To start the game press either the right or left button. the right button is a game of 10 inputs where it gets progessivly harder while the left is endless where the only way to win is to lose. the game beeps at  you when you have to do something or you lose. red and green pixels are for buttons blue is for slideswitch yellow is to blow at it and teal is to shake it. when each one is called you  start with 2 secounds before you lose and each one you complete casues the time to reduce slightly. In the game of ten if you win it flashes blue and restarts in that mode if you want to restart back to endless or ten you press the reset button. wrongs inputs are allowed becasue the time is a far bigger challenge and the mic and shaking are sensitive.
