## About me 
Here is the final game I have made for the class. The game is inspired by bop it and will use the buttons switches lights microphone and accerometer found in the cpx board. the game will call an action and after a period of time if th input is not given then it will end the game. the actions called are reandomly selected. the game start with button resses that put it into either endless or fixed level mode. the outpts will come from te speaker and the ligths.
